mars,Mars,4,Mars is smaller than Earth and Venus. It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a SurfacePressure of 6.1 millibars.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg/440px-OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg,0.642,6792,227.9
jupiter,Jupiter,5,"Jupiter is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has 79 known satellites.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Jupiter_and_its_shrunken_Great_Red_Spot.jpg/440px-Jupiter_and_its_shrunken_Great_Red_Spot.jpg,1898,142984,778.6
saturn,Saturn,6,"Saturn, distinguished by its extensive RingSystem, has several similarities to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive, at 95 MâŠ•. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Saturn_during_Equinox.jpg/530px-Saturn_during_Equinox.jpg,568,120536,1433.5
uranus,Uranus,7,"Uranus is the lightest of the outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. It has a much colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space. Uranus has 27 known satellites.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Uranus2.jpg/510px-Uranus2.jpg,86.8,51118,2872.5
neptune,Neptune,8,"Neptune, though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Neptune_Full.jpg/440px-Neptune_Full.jpg,102,49528,4495.1
pluto,Pluto,9,"The dwarf planet Pluto is the largest known object in the Kuiper belt. When discovered in 1930, it was considered to be the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Pluto_in_True_Color_-_High-Res.jpg/440px-Pluto_in_True_Color_-_High-Res.jpg,0.0146,2370,5906.4
